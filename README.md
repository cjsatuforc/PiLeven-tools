# PiLeven Tools

This is an installer script to configure the Freetronics PiLeven "Arduino Uno compatible Raspberry Pi expansion" board.

PiLeven support requires the [wiringpi](http://wiringpi.com) framework. For Raspbian the installer script will try to install it automatically, but on other distros you will need to install it separately.

For detailed steps involved in configuring the PiLeven, see the [Freetronics PiLeven Getting Started Guide](http://freetronics.com/pages/pileven-getting-started-guide)
